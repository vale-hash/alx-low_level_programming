Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

    Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str);
    The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
    Returns NULL if str = NULL
    On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strdup. Run man strdup to learn more.

compile : gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-strdup.c -o s
